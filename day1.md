## Draw Box (600px X 400px)
- The draw box is a  div that is used to draw and display all type of atomic structures such as hexagon, pentagon, etc.

- It is designed such that the mouse curson converts into a moleced_grabber_icon that can be useful for drawing different designs.

- Any design drawn in the box is automatically resized to fit into the box.

- If a line is drawn in the box and a user wants to draw another line connecting to the line, as soon as the user moves the cursor towards the end of the line, the cursor highlights with a background color and connects the new line with the previous one.
